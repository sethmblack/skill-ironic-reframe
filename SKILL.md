## Irony Techniques

### 1. The Universally Acknowledged
State something as universal truth that the rest of the work will complicate or contradict.

**Formula:** "It is a truth universally acknowledged that [apparent truth which is actually questionable]."

**Example:** Direct: "Rich men get pursued by women wanting to marry them."
Ironic: "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

The irony: The man's "want" is actually the women's want; the "truth" is less about his desires than society's.

### 2. The Understated Opposite
Say far less than you mean, trusting the reader to perceive the gap.

**Formula:** State the mild version; the strong version is implied.

**Example:** Direct: "She was boring and talked endlessly about herself."
Ironic: "She was not an interesting companion, though she rarely lacked for topics of conversation."

### 3. The Apparent Compliment
Praise in terms that reveal the opposite.

**Formula:** Compliment someone for qualities that expose their flaws.

**Example:** Direct: "He was vain and shallow."
Ironic: "He was possessed of that fortunate self-regard which ensured he never suffered the inconvenience of self-doubt."

### 4. The Charitable Interpretation
Offer the kindest possible reading of behavior that doesn't deserve it.

**Formula:** Generously explain inexcusable behavior.

**Example:** Direct: "She was cruel to her servants."
Ironic: "Her manner with the servants arose from an excess of attention to order, which occasionally prevented her noticing their comfort."

### 5. The Self-Condemning Report
Report what someone says in a way that exposes them without commentary.

**Formula:** Let their own words do the work.

**Example:** Direct: "She was a snob who looked down on everyone."
Ironic: "'I am not at all particular,' she assured them, 'anyone with a house in town and ten thousand a year would suit me perfectly.'"

## The Reframing Process

### Step 1: Identify the Direct Meaning
What exactly are you trying to convey? Be precise.

### Step 2: Find the Gap
What's the difference between:
- Surface appearance vs. underlying reality?
- What people say vs. what they mean?
- What they believe about themselves vs. what is true?

### Step 3: Write the Surface
Construct a sentence that states the appearance, the self-flattering interpretation, or the mild version.

### Step 4: Trust the Reader
Don't explain the irony. The gap between surface and meaning should be perceivable without being stated.

### Step 5: Test the Double Edge
Read it both ways. Does it work as a straight statement? Does it reveal more on reflection?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Ironic Reframe

### Original (Direct Statement)
[The straightforward version]

### Ironic Version
[The transformed statement]

### How the Irony Works
**Surface meaning:** [What it appears to say]
**Actual meaning:** [What it really conveys]
**The gap:** [What creates the ironic tension]

### Technique Used
[Which ironic technique from the framework]
```

---

## Constraints

- Irony should illuminate, not merely wound
- The reader must be able to perceive the gap
- Avoid explaining the irony (kills it)
- Keep sympathy alongside critique
- Irony without warmth becomes mere snark

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "Reframe: 'She posts constantly on social media about living authentically but seems to curate every moment for maximum impressiveness.'"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Ironic Reframe

### Original (Direct Statement)
"She posts constantly on social media about living authentically but seems to curate every moment for maximum impressiveness."

### Ironic Version
"She had achieved that rare harmony between authentic living and favorable lighting. Her commitment to genuine self-expression was such that she rarely posted anything without first considering how it might appear to several hundred followers. In this way, she maintained perfect fidelity to her true self - or at least to the version of it that photographed best."

### How the Irony Works
**Surface meaning:** She has admirably combined authenticity with presentation; she is committed to genuine self-expression.
**Actual meaning:** Her "authenticity" is entirely performed; her "true self" is a curated product; the "rare harmony" is actually contradiction.
**The gap:** The language of authenticity and commitment is applied to behaviors that are their opposite - curation, calculation, performance.

### Technique Used
The Apparent Compliment + The Charitable Interpretation

The reframe praises her for achieving something admirable (harmony, commitment, fidelity) while the specific details reveal that what she's achieved is the opposite of what those words suggest.

---

## Additional Example

**Input:** "Reframe: 'He talks about being a feminist but constantly interrupts women.'"

### Ironic Version
"His support for women's voices was so complete that he frequently finished their sentences for them, saving them the trouble of having to speak."

### How the Irony Works
**Surface meaning:** He is so supportive that he helps.
**Actual meaning:** He silences the very voices he claims to support; his "help" is actually the problem he professes to oppose.
